# AgentFirst Framework

**Architecture Before Autonomy.**

AgentFirst is a mission-critical governance framework designed to safely integrate Autonomous AI Agents into Enterprise environments. We do not build conversational chatbots; we architect the **Gatekeeper Middleware** that ensures large language models operate within strict mathematical boundaries (Domain-Driven Design).

## 🚀 The Core Thesis

Our architectural foundation is built upon a simple provable thesis: **Autonomous models inevitably degrade complex systems (Systemic Entropy) if they operate without rigid, hard-coded boundaries.**

By granting Tool Use permissions to probabilistic LLMs, organizations delegate structural authority to non-deterministic systems. Without rigid middleware, *Cross-Domain Invasions* occur (e.g., a customer support agent independently mutating billing tables), leading to critical failures executing in milliseconds.

AgentFirst ends this chaos by isolating machine intelligence into **Strict Domains**. Our middleware ensures that unbreakable software rules guarantee an AI agent never intrudes into the jurisdiction of unauthorized legacy systems.

## 🏗️ The Operational Model (Topology)

AgentFirst operates across three governance layers:

1. **AgentFirst Core (The Foundry):** The foundational infrastructure (Middleware + Gatekeeper) that processes natural language intents and shields APIs against systemic AI entropy.
2. **AgentFirst Fleet (Pre-Trained):** A constellation of pre-trained autonomous robots engineered for aggressive corporate scenarios (Logistics, Retail, Backoffice), natively executing on top of the Core.
3. **AgentFirst SWAT (Custom Deployments):** Our forward-deployed engineering squad. We infiltrate legacy architectures to build custom, 100% autonomous, and secured operations in exactly 4 weeks.

## 🛡️ The Secured Pilot Framework

We transition enterprises from fragile proofs of concept to bulletproof operations.

- **Week 1: Triage & Architecture:** Mapping critical APIs and designing Restrictive Domain Policies.
- **Week 2: Infiltration & Development:** Building the first Autonomous Agent encapsulated inside the Gatekeeper.
- **Week 3: Stress-Testing:** Simulating extreme AI hallucinations to prove systemic containment.
- **Week 4: Handover:** Production deploy. Handing over the secure repository (Golden Path) to the internal engineering team.

### Repository Contents

This initial repository serves as the public landing page and theoretical introduction to the AgentFirst framework.

- `index.html`: The main entry point for the public-facing manifesto and service offering.
- `app.js`: Contains vanilla JS logic, i18n translation maps (PT/EN), and the interactive terminal simulation of the Gatekeeper in action.
- `style.css`: The hyper-modern UI/UX design system driving the web platform.
- `af-core/` and `lollapet-agentic-system/`: (Internal architecture references) Mock repositories demonstrating the Gatekeeper policy execution (`agentfirst.yaml`) and CLI concepts.
