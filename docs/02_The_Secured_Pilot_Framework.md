# The Secured Pilot Framework (Go-To-Market Offering)

## 1. The "Skin in the Game" Value Proposition
The traditional consulting model (Months of discovery -> PowerPoint recommendations) is obsolete in the AI era. C-Levels do not want theoretical frameworks; they want tangible features delivered safely.

AgentFirst operates as a **"Secured Pilot Framework" (Foundation Builder)**. We don't just audit the architecture; we build the first AI Agent for the client, with Governance and Domain Boundaries explicitly coded into the infrastructure.

## 2. The 4-Week "Alpha" Engagement

We transition companies from "Zero" to "Secured Autonomy" in 4 weeks.

### Week 1: Fast Domain Discovery (The Blueprint)
*   **Goal:** Map the *Bounded Context* of the specific Pilot Agent.
*   **Action:** Define strict boundaries. (e.g., "The HR Agent can read resumes but cannot trigger payroll APIs").
*   **Output:** The initial `agentfirst.yaml` (Decision Architecture Matrix).

### Weeks 2-3: The Hands-on Build (The Gatekeepers)
*   **Goal:** Build the Agent's core logic inside an "Agentic Scaffold."
*   **Action:** Implement the AI logic, but strictly behind our architectural defenses. We build the API Middlewares that intercept the LLM's intentions and validate them against the `agentfirst.yaml` rules.
*   **Output:** The MVP Agent operating securely in staging.

### Week 4: Handover & The "Golden Path"
*   **Goal:** Deploy the Secured Pilot and educate the client's Engineering team.
*   **Action:** Deploy the Agent along with the CI/CD Governance tools (like the AgentFirst CLI).
*   **Output:** 
    1. A working, business-valuable AI Agent in production.
    2. **The Golden Path Repository:** We leave the client with the architectural template and the CI/CD controls. From that day on, any new Agent their engineers build must inherit the "AgentFirst Core" governance, ensuring sustainable, risk-free scalability.
